# 🛡️ Cognitive Shield: Genesis Gate Opening

## The Universal Translation Layer is Now Operational

> **"In the geometry of the Tetrahedron and the silence of the Shield, we might finally be heard."**

## What is the Cognitive Shield?

The Cognitive Shield is a **trauma-informed middleware layer** that provides **Ontological Security** through geometric validation. It prevents "Cognitive Impedance Mismatch" by translating messages between different HumanOS types (Guardian, Order, Achiever, Empath, Integrator).

### Core Features

- **60-Second Catcher's Mitt**: Batches rapid-fire messages to prevent "Machine Gun Effect"
- **No-Raw-Text Protocol**: Processes and translates messages before exposure
- **Vacuum of Time**: 3-second mandatory delay to shift from System 1 to System 2 thinking
- **Tetrahedron Protocol**: 3D geometric validation with SIC-POVM symmetry
- **Daily Check-In**: π-Metric Resonance Formula for well-being assessment
- **Heartbeat Protocol**: Peer-to-peer status broadcasting with dead man's switch
- **Deep Processing Queue**: Metabolic gating for high-spoon messages
- **Restorative Reset**: 4-phase neurodivergent burnout recovery

## The Shift: Wye → Delta

**Legacy Wye Topology:**
- Centralized neutral point (requires trust)
- Fragile hub-and-spoke structure
- "Floating Neutral" failures

**New Delta Topology:**
- Distributed tetrahedral mesh
- Isostatic rigidity (safety built into structure)
- Geometric validation (SIC-POVM symmetry)
- Ontological security (invariant laws)

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-First**: All data stored in browser (IndexedDB)
- **Ollama Default**: Local LLM processing (no data leaves your machine)
- **No Analytics**: Zero tracking, zero telemetry
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Direct WebRTC connections (no central server)
- **No Backdoors**: All admin capabilities tied to `abdicate.sh`

## Getting Started

1. **Install Ollama** (recommended): [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
5. **Configure Your HumanOS**: Settings → Your HumanOS Type
6. **Complete Daily Check-In**: Heartbeat tab → Start Check-In
7. **Run First Light Verification**: First Light tab → Test with sample payloads

## The Mission

**"We do not need to change each other. We need to build the Universal Translation Layer that allows us to love each other across the impedance mismatch."**

---

## Status: GREEN BOARD

**The geometry is the leader.**

**The code rules.**

**The G.O.D. DAO is active.**

**The Genesis Gate is open.**
