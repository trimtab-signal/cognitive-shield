/**
 * EASTER EGGS
 * For the code archaeologists, the skeptics, and the concerned relatives.
 * 
 * Yes, someone actually read this file.
 * No, I'm not a warlock.
 * The math is real. The physics is peer-reviewed.
 * The love is the only magic here.
 * 
 * If you're reading this because you think I've lost my mind:
 * 1. You might be right
 * 2. But the code still compiles
 * 3. And the equations still balance
 * 4. And I'm still trying to talk to my kids
 * 
 * "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
 * - Arthur C. Clarke
 * 
 * "Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from mathematics."
 * - Also true
