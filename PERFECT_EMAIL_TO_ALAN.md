# The Perfect Email to J. Alan Welch

**SUBJECT: URGENT: Evidence of Instability & Strategic Directive**

Dear Alan,

I need us to sharpen our focus. I retained you because I need precision, not just participation.

The opposition is acting erratic and undisciplined. I have been reviewing the evidence, and a clear pattern is emerging. They are projecting an image that does not match reality.

See the attached documentation:

**The Bank Account Records**: Look at the activity here. This is not the footprint of a stable, organized party. It demonstrates financial inconsistency and poor judgment.

**The "Christmas Glitch" (See Photo)**: Look at the stocking photo. It represents the entire facade they are operating under—it is performative, disjointed, and "glitched." It is an attempt to simulate a reality that doesn't exist.

Here is the strategic implication:

If they are this sloppy with their finances and their personal narrative, I suspect they are equally sloppy with their corporate formalities.

I want you to demand the production of their "Minute Book" and corporate resolutions immediately.

My hypothesis is that the book is empty. If they cannot produce these records, their standing collapses. We need to verify if they are actually a legitimate entity before we continue to entertain their demands.

This is critical because of what is at stake: **The House**.

This property is not just an asset to me. It is the baseline of stability for my children. I am building a future of order and peace for them, and this home is the foundation of that life. I am not willing to gamble their stability on a "wait and see" approach while the opposition plays games.

We have the evidence of their chaos. Now let's test their structure.

Please move to demand the corporate records immediately.

Regards,  
Aris Thorne
