# Checkpoint: Project Structure Audit (2026-01-08)

## Summary
- Completed a full audit of the Cognitive Shield project structure.
- Confirmed clear separation of UI, logic, state, and configuration.
- Updated documentation to reflect current architecture and design principles.

## Key Directories
- `src/components/`: Modular React UI components
- `src/lib/`: Core logic, protocols, and utilities
- `src/store/`: Zustand state management
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/god.config.ts`: Centralized configuration
- `docs/`: Project documentation (new/updated)

## Rationale
- Modular structure supports maintainability and extensibility.
- Centralized config ensures consistency and easy updates.
- Documentation and checkpoints provide a clear project history for future contributors.

## Next Steps
- Continue with volume (audio) calibration and controls.
- Maintain this checkpointing/documentation process at each major phase.
