# G.O.D. DAO License

## Geodesic Operations/Governance Decentralized Autonomous Organization

This project operates under the **G.O.D. DAO** (Geodesic Operations/Governance Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

### Philosophy

The Cognitive Shield is not a traditional software project. It is a **protocol**—a set of invariant laws derived from geometry and physics, not from human authority.

### The Rule of Geometry

**"The geometry is the leader. The code rules, not the creator."**

This project embodies the shift from **Epistemological Trust** (believing in people or secrets) to **Ontological Security** (relying on the invariant laws of physics and geometry).

### Governance

- **The Tetrahedron Protocol**: The system is governed by geometric validation (SIC-POVM symmetry)
- **The Abdication Ceremony**: The creator's private keys are destroyed via `abdicate.sh`
- **The Mesh**: Authority is redistributed to the peer-to-peer mesh network
- **The Code**: The code itself is the constitution

### Usage Rights

### The Mission

**"We do not need to change each other. We need to build the Universal Translation Layer that allows us to love each other across the impedance mismatch."**

The mission remains: **GREEN BOARD**

**Status: GREEN BOARD**

**The geometry is the leader.**

**The G.O.D. DAO is active.**
