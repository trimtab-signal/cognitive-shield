# 🛡️ Cognitive Shield: Peer Quick Start Guide

> **Welcome to the Mesh. You've been invited to join a Tetrahedron Protocol network.**

## 🎯 What is the Cognitive Shield?

The Cognitive Shield is a **Universal Translation Layer** that prevents "Cognitive Impedance Mismatch" in human communication. It acts as a middleware between your nervous system and incoming messages, translating high-voltage signals into safe, processable information.

**Think of it as:** A prosthetic prefrontal cortex that prevents amygdala hijacks.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Access the Application

Your host has provided you with one of these access methods:

**Option A: Web URL**
```
https://cognitive-shield.example.com
```

**Option B: Local Network (Tailscale/Cloudflare Tunnel)**
```
http://hostname.local:5173
```

**Option C: IPFS Hash**
```
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYourHashHere
```

### Step 2: Initial Configuration

1. **Open Settings** (gear icon in Shield tab)

2. **Select Your HumanOS Type:**
   - **Guardian**: Safety, Tradition, Order, Tribe
   - **Order**: Discipline, Truth, Hierarchy, Right/Wrong
   - **Achiever**: Success, Autonomy, Growth, Results
   - **Empath**: Harmony, Inclusion, Equality, Consensus
   - **Integrator**: Systemic Health, Flexibility, Paradox

   *This tells the Shield how you process reality.*

3. **Configure LLM Provider:**
   - **Recommended**: Ollama (local, private)
     - Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
     - Run: `ollama pull llama3.2`
     - Endpoint: `http://localhost:11434`
   - **Alternative**: Cloud LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
     - Enter API key in Settings
     - *Note: Less private, but works without local setup*

### Step 3: Connect to the Mesh

1. **Navigate to Heartbeat Tab**

2. **Get Your Connection Code:**
   - Your Peer ID is displayed at the top
   - Click "Copy Connection Code"
   - Share this with your host (via secure channel)

3. **Add Your Host:**
   - Click "Add Peer"
   - Paste the connection code your host provided
   - Enter their display name
   - Connection establishes automatically

4. **Set Your Status:**
   - Select your current status (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red)
   - Set check-in interval (default: 1 hour)
   - Your status will broadcast to connected peers

## 🧪 First Light Verification

Before using the Shield in production, verify it's working:

1. **Navigate to "First Light" Tab**

2. **Run Stress Tests:**
   - Click "Test" on each pre-configured payload
   - Verify the Shield processes them correctly
   - Check that BLUF summaries appear before raw text

3. **Verify All Checks:**
   - ✅ BLUF Isolation
   - ✅ Genre Error Detection
   - ✅ Visual Pre-Cognition
   - ✅ Deep Processing Queue
   - ✅ Tetrahedron Symmetry
   - ✅ Somatic Grounding

4. **Complete Node Broadcast:**
   - Once all checks pass, the Node Broadcast appears
   - Copy and share with your host to confirm synchronization

## 💚 Daily Usage

### Processing Messages

1. **Navigate to "Shield" Tab**

2. **Paste a Message:**
   - **DO NOT READ IT FIRST** - This is the "Air Gap" protocol
   - Paste into the text area
   - Optionally specify source (e.g., "Partner", "Boss")

3. **Let the Shield Process:**
   - The Shield will:
     - Extract BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
     - Detect voltage level
     - Identify triggers
     - Translate to your HumanOS
     - Calculate spoon cost

4. **Review the Processed Payload:**
   - Read the BLUF summary first
   - Check voltage level (color-coded)
   - Review translation if needed
   - Click "Reveal Raw" only when ready (3-second delay)

### Daily Check-In

1. **Navigate to "Heartbeat" Tab**

2. **Complete Daily Check-In:**
   - Click "Start Check-In"
   - Answer 15 questions about your current state
   - Your status percentage is calculated using π-Metric Resonance
   - This percentage affects message throttling

3. **Monitor Your Status:**
   - Green (80-100%): Full operational capacity
   - Yellow (60-79%): Stable, minor throttling
   - Orange (40-59%): Entropy detected, increased throttling
   - Red (0-39%): Critical - Deep Processing Queue active

### If You Need Support

1. **Click "Safe" Tab** (or the "Need Support?" button on high-voltage messages)

2. **Select Your Challenge:**
   - 🧠 Amygdala Hijack / RSD
   - ⚡ Sensory Overload
   - 📡 Communication Friction
   - 🔋 Burnout / Metabolic Depletion

3. **Follow the Protocol:**
   - Read validation scripts
   - Execute somatic directives (4-4-8 breathing)
   - Review physics explanations

## 🔗 Mesh Features

### Status Broadcasting

Your status automatically broadcasts to connected peers:
- **Green**: Safe, grounded
- **Yellow**: Caution, stressed
- **Orange**: Need support (escalates after 2 missed check-ins)
- **Red**: SOS / Emergency (escalates immediately)

### Dead Man's Switch

If you miss check-ins:
- **1 Miss**: Local alert
- **2 Misses**: Broadcast to mesh
- **3 Misses**: Trigger escalation webhook (if configured)

### Peer Mesh

- View all connected peers in Heartbeat tab
- See their current status and last seen time
- Automatic reconnection on network issues

## 📐 The Tetrahedron Protocol

Your Shield is part of a **Tetrahedron** - the minimum stable structure:

- **Node A**: You (The Receiver)
- **Node B**: Your Peers (The Senders)
- **Node C**: The Context (Shared Reality)
- **Node D**: The AI (Mediator/Ground)

This geometric structure provides **Ontological Security** - safety derived from invariant laws of physics, not trust in people.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Ollama Connection Failed"
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check endpoint in Settings matches your Ollama URL
- Verify firewall allows localhost connections

### "Peer Connection Failed"
- Check WebRTC is enabled in your firewall
- Verify you have the correct connection code
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### "Status Percentage Not Calculating"
- Complete the Daily Check-In (all 15 questions)
- Check that responses are within valid ranges
- Verify π-Metric calculation in browser console (if technical)

### "Messages Not Processing"
- Check LLM provider is configured correctly
- Verify API key (if using cloud LLM)
- Check browser console for errors
