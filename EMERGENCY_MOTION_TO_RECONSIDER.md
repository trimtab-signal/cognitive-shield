## IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CAMDEN COUNTY STATE OF GEORGIA CHRISTYN ELIZABETH JOHNSON, Plaintiff V. WILLIAM RODGER JOHNSON, Defendant CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 2025CV936

DEFENDANT'S EMERGENCY MOTION TO RECONSIDER AND SET ASIDE ORDER DATED OCTOBER 23, 2025 (EXHIBIT K), FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER & CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST, AND FOR SANCTIONS

COMES NOW the Defendant, William Rodger Johnson, Pro Se, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to RECONSIDER and SET ASIDE the Order dated October 23, 2025 (Exhibit K), on the grounds that the Order is based on fundamental errors of law, constitutes an illegal seizure of separate property, was procured through Opposing Counsel's documented fraud and retaliation, and arose from a compromised process that forced the termination of his former counsel.

### I. GROUNDS FOR SETTING ASIDE ALL PREDICATE ORDERS (COMPROMISED PROCESS)

The entire enforcement action is fatally flawed, originating from procedural failures that prevented the Defendant from being fairly and competently represented.

#### A. Genesis of Procedural Malpractice: The October 16, 2025 Order
The initial Order dated October 16, 2025 (Exhibit F), failed to adequately protect the Defendant's separate, pre-marital property and best financial interests, placing him under severe duress and financial threat. The Order was issued without proper consideration of the complexity of the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) asset (Exhibit C: TSP Court Orders/POAs) and despite documented efforts by prior counsel to move the matter forward (Exhibits D & E: East Emails). This fundamental failure in representation resulting directly from the Court's Order necessitated the immediate termination of the Defendant's former counsel, Mr. Joseph East, Esq. (Exhibit G: Termination Email), for a documented failure of fiduciary duty. The Defendant, now forced to proceed pro se (Exhibit H: Notification of No Counsel) as a litigant with documented disabilities, requests the Court acknowledge that the process that led to the termination of his counsel and placed him in this position is fundamentally unfair and requires corrective judicial intervention.

#### B. Illegal Seizure of Separate, Non-Marital Property (Fundamental Error)
The subsequent Order's requirement for a full withdrawal of the Defendant's Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) illegally invaded his separate property interest.

1. Separate Property: The Defendant's Civilian Career Brief (Exhibit N) documents his Service Computation Date for Leave (SCD Leave) of June 22, 2009. The parties were married on December 18, 2015. The Order forced the withdrawal and distribution of contributions and earnings accumulated for over six years prior to the marriage date, which are legally non-marital assets.
2. Marital Debt: The Order also failed to account for the outstanding TSP loan (a marital debt) of $7,236.88 which should have been deducted from the marital estate before division.
3. Result: The Court Order has resulted in the immediate, illegal, and irreversible seizure of the Defendant's pre-marital, non-marital property, which constitutes a fundamental legal error requiring the Order to be set aside.

#### C. Fraud on the Court and Quantifiable Damages (Material Misrepresentation)
The Order was based on Opposing Counsel's false statement regarding federal tax law.

1. OC's Fraud: On October 21, 2025, Ms. McGhan emailed the Defendant stating: "A QDRO will not prevent the 10% penalty. The 10% penalty happens anytime you withdraw from a TSP before retirement age... You can't avoid the penalty in any way on this." (See Exhibit L: OC Email). This directly contradicts federal documentation provided to TSP participants (Exhibit B: TSP Payment Rights Notice).
2. The Truth (26 U.S.C. § 72(t)(2)(C)): This statement is a material misrepresentation of federal law. 26 U.S.C. § 72(t)(2)(C) explicitly exempts distributions made pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) or Retirement Benefits Court Order (RBCO) from the 10% early withdrawal penalty.
3. Resulting Damage: The Court, relying on OC's false assertion, mandated a penalized withdrawal instead of the proper RBCO procedure. The mandatory withdrawal of the Gross Distribution of $70,791.85 caused the Defendant an immediate, quantifiable, and permanent tax penalty loss of $7,079.19 (10% of the Gross Distribution, as confirmed by Exhibit A).

#### D. Liability for Total Withholding Cost ($14,158.37)
The forced withdrawal of the Gross Distribution of $70,791.85 resulted in $14,158.37 being immediately withheld for Federal Tax and Penalty (Exhibit A). This entire financial loss should be borne by the Plaintiff's share of the marital estate and/or sanctioned against her counsel for the following reasons:

1. 10% Early Withdrawal Penalty (Avoidable): The $7,079.19 penalty was entirely avoidable had Plaintiff's counsel not committed fraud regarding the availability of an RBCO/QDRO. Plaintiff is therefore liable for the entire $7,079.19 penalty as a sanctionable set-off.
2. Income Tax Burden: The remainder of the withholding, and any other income tax ultimately due, was triggered solely by the premature, penalized withdrawal forced by Plaintiff's counsel's fraudulent motion. As this was done for the benefit of both parties (to pay marital debt and fund the marital split), the income tax liability should have been split pro-rata.

### II. EMERGENCY NEED FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER / CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST)

The Defendant complied with the Order dated October 23, 2025 (Exhibit K), under duress, and the Net Cash Payment of $49,396.60 is scheduled to become liquid in the Defendant's bank account on or about Monday, October 27, 2025. Immediate distribution of the funds according to the flawed Order will result in irreparable harm because:

1. Unrecoverable Separate Property: Once distributed to the Plaintiff, the Defendant's pre-marital, non-marital property (proven by Exhibit N and Exhibit M) will be immediately dissipated and unrecoverable, necessitating a second lawsuit based on fraud to recover it.
2. Dissipation of Sanctionable Funds: The Plaintiff's purported share includes funds that must be retained to reimburse the Defendant for the $7,079.19 fraud-induced penalty and the $2,000.00 improper sanction fee.
