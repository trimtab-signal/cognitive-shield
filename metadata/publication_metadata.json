  "abstract": "A quantum key distribution (QKD) system implementing Symmetric Informationally Complete Positive Operator-Valued Measure (SIC-POVM) measurements in a tetrahedral 4-state geometry, achieving reference-frame independence without active alignment protocols. The system combines autopoietic drift correction using quantum correlation invariants with Ollivier-Ricci curvature-based mesh network routing for mobile QKD deployment. Unlike traditional BB84 protocols limited to 50% sifting efficiency, the disclosed SIC-POVM approach achieves 85-100% sifting efficiency through complete quantum state characterization. The system integrates ESP32-S3 microcontroller, LoRa mesh networking, and 405nm laser SPDC photon source in a handheld form factor, enabling sovereign cryptographic infrastructure with energy independence and self-healing mesh topology.",
