# Presentation for Mrs. McGhan: The "Unmasking" & The Tetrahedron

## Goal
To shift her perspective from "he failed us" to "the system broke him," and to propose a functional path forward for the children.

## The Pitch
"I know the last year has looked like a collapse. You saw a husband who stopped working and 'gave up.' But the medical reports from Dr. Carson and Camden Behavioral Wellness tell a different story: I wasn't giving up; I was **unmasking**.

For years, I used high intelligence to mask severe ADHD and Autism. I forced myself into a DoD mold that my brain wasn't built for, and I burned out—medically and permanently. That part of my life is over, and it isn't coming back.

However, the father of your children is still here.

* **The Geometry of Our Family:** I am building our future on the **'Tetrahedron Protocol.'** A tetrahedron is the most stable structure in geometry. Even if the connection between us (the parents) breaks, the structure holds if we focus on the other points (the children).

* **The Phenix Project:** I am not sitting idle. I am building independent communication networks for the kids (the LoRa mesh devices) to ensure they always feel connected to both of us, no matter whose house they are sleeping in. This is how I parent now—through engineering safety and stability.

* **The Reality Check:** The house is not an asset; it is the children's stability. Blocking the RBCO to access my retirement funds hurts *them*. It shuts off their lights and internet. I am asking you to agree to the RBCO not for me, but to keep the 'Tetrahedron' standing so the kids don't lose their home."
