## What Went Well
- Clear, modular project structure enabled efficient auditing and targeted improvements.
- Audio volume controls are precise, persistent, and user-friendly.
- Codebase is clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.
- Connection feedback is now holistic, accessible, and visually clear for both mesh and AI.
- Checkpoints and documentation are in place for future contributors and project history.

## Challenges
- Monorepo structure requires running scripts from the correct subdirectory.
- Some advanced features (e.g., mesh, LLM) require ongoing monitoring and user guidance for troubleshooting.

## Lessons Learned
- Investing in modularity and documentation pays off for rapid iteration and onboarding.
- User feedback and clear status indicators are essential for trust and usability.
