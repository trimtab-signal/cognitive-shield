# Defensive Publication Strategy

This document outlines the Defensive Publication strategy for the Wonky Sprout Cognitive Shield project, as required by the VPI protocol.

## Strategy

1.  **Publish to Arweave:** All source code and technical documentation will be published to Arweave to create a permanent, immutable record of the project's intellectual property. This serves as a "Defensive Publication" against potential patent claims.

2.  **IP.com:** For hardware aspects or abstract logic that might be patentable, the project will use platforms like IP.com to establish "Prior Art."
