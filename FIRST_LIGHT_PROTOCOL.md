# 🛰️ First Light Synchronization Protocol

> **"The moment the architecture becomes alive."**

---

## Operational Verification Sequence

Execute these steps to verify the integrity of the **Digital Centaur** and confirm the transition from structural design to operational reality.

---

## 1. High-Arousal Stress Test

### Objective
Verify **Impedance Matching** under high-velocity input.

### Steps

1. Navigate to **First Light** tab
2. Select a test payload (e.g., "High Voltage: Hostility")
3. Click **Test** to inject into the Shield
4. Wait for processing (60-second batching window)

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **BLUF Isolation**: Raw text is hidden, only emotion-neutral summary visible
- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure**: "Press to Reveal" button appears
- [ ] **Vacuum of Time**: 3-second countdown before raw text can be revealed
- [ ] **Color Coding**: Alert Orange (#F57600) for high voltage, Soft Blue (#B3C7F7) for calm
- [ ] **Spoons Display**: Cognitive cost (1-5) visible on payload card
- [ ] **Emotional Valence**: Border color matches Plutchik mapping

### Success Metric
User sees **BLUF summary** before any raw data, preventing initial **Amygdala Hijack**.

---

## 2. Metabolic Guardrail Activation

### Objective
Verify **Deep Processing Queue** acts as an "Isolation Transformer" for the nervous system.

### Steps

1. Navigate to **Heartbeat** tab
2. Complete **Daily Check-In** with responses that yield < 25% status
   - Answer questions to indicate low energy, high stress, burnout
3. Navigate back to **Shield** tab
4. Inject a high-spoon test payload (3+ spoons expected)
5. Wait for processing

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Status Percentage**: Check-in shows < 25% (Orange/Red zone)
- [ ] **Automatic Gating**: High-spoon message appears in **Deep Processing Queue**
- [ ] **No Primary Notification**: Message does NOT appear in main processed list
- [ ] **Queue Display**: Deep Processing Queue component visible with message
- [ ] **Promotion Available**: "Promote to Processed" button functional

### Success Metric
Shield automatically gates high-cost messages when status < 25%, preventing **Thermal Overload**.

---

## 3. Geometric Rigidity Check (The Fourth Node)

### Objective
Confirm stability of **Delta Topology** through SIC-POVM symmetry.

### Steps

1. Navigate to **Tetrahedron** tab
2. Observe the 3D visualization
3. Check status display at bottom

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Symmetry %**: Near 100% (perfect tetrahedron)
- [ ] **Curvature (κ)**: Positive value (convergent/resonance)
- [ ] **Status**: "✓ Ontologically Secure" displayed
- [ ] **Color**: Soft Blue (#B3C7F7) indicating stable state
- [ ] **Purity**: Density matrix purity > 0.8
- [ ] **No Deformation**: Tetrahedron maintains regular shape

### Success Metric
Tetrahedron maintains **Isostatic Rigidity** with positive curvature, signaling **Ontological Security**.

---

## 4. Somatic Grounding Loop

### Objective
Engage **Haptic Vagus Signal** to break "Frozen Stillness."

### Steps

1. Navigate to **Shield** tab
2. Click **"Need Support?"** on a high-voltage message
3. **"You Are Safe"** menu opens
4. Navigate to breathing exercises
5. Select **"Calming Breath (4-4-8)"**
6. Click **Start Breathing**

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Haptic Pulse**: Vibration pattern activates (if device supports)
- [ ] **Breathing Timer**: Countdown displays (4s inhale, 7s hold, 8s exhale)
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Breathing phase indicator updates
- [ ] **Tone Meter**: If payload provided, Genre Error detection active
- [ ] **Vagus Signal Button**: "Activate Vagus Signal (4-4-8)" functional

### Success Metric
Haptic pulse synchronizes with somatic directive, signaling safety to the **Vagus Nerve**.

---

## 5. Genre Error Detection

### Objective
Verify automatic **Physics/Poetics** translation.

### Steps

1. Use test payload: **"Genre Error: Physics vs Poetics"**
2. Process through Shield
3. Open **"You Are Safe"** menu (if high voltage)
4. Check **Tone Meter** section

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Genre Error Detected**: Tone Meter shows "Genre Error Detected"
- [ ] **Validation Script**: Message appears: "You are speaking Physics; the sender is speaking Poetics"
- [ ] **Auto-Haptic**: Strong haptic pulse triggers on detection
- [ ] **Color Coding**: Alert Orange for detected mismatch

### Success Metric
Shield automatically flags and explains Genre Errors, preventing bidirectional communication failure.

---

## 🏛️ Post-Verification: GREEN BOARD Status

Once all checks are complete:

### Final Verification

- [ ] All 6 verification steps show **✓ Pass** in First Light tab
- [ ] Status displays: **"STATUS: GREEN BOARD"**
- [ ] No failed verification steps

### System Status

**The system has achieved Actual Authority.**

You are no longer navigating by "Apparent Authority"—the failing institutions of the **Wye Topology**—but by the invariant laws of geometry and code.

Timestamp: [ISO_8601]
Status: GREEN BOARD

Verification Results:
✓ BLUF Isolation: PASS
✓ Genre Error Detection: PASS
✓ Visual Pre-Cognition: PASS
✓ Deep Processing Queue: PASS
✓ Tetrahedron Symmetry: PASS
✓ Somatic Grounding: PASS
