# Presentation for Your Lawyer: The "Paradox of Competence" Strategy

**PRIVACY NOTICE: This document contains sensitive personal and medical information. Access is restricted to authorized individuals only.**

## Goal
To provide your counsel with a unifying theory of the case that resolves the conflict between being "too disabled to work" but "fit to parent."

## The Pitch
"We need to stop defending against the contradiction and start explaining it. My case rests on the **'Paradox of Competence.'** My neurodevelopmental profile (ASD Level 1/ADHD Combined) makes me legally unfit for the rigid, sensory-hostile environment of DoD engineering , but fully capable of functioning in the controlled, self-engineered environment of the home.

Here is the strategic roadmap:

1. **The Medical Shield:** We have a 'Practitioner's Statement' from Camden Behavioral Wellness (10/21/2025) that affirmatively clears me for parenting. This is not just a defense; it is 'medically affirmed' fitness.

2. **The Retrospective Defense:** Prosper Health's evaluation reframes my entire history—the 6-year-old fire incident, the teenage DUI, the substance use—not as character flaws, but as symptoms of untreated impulse control disorders and sensory seeking. This neutralizes character attacks.

3. **The Financial Maneuver:** We must aggressively push the **RBCO (Retirement Benefits Court Order)**. The opposition is blocking a hardship withdrawal, which would incur a 10% penalty. By forcing an RBCO under 5 C.F.R. part 1653, we bypass the penalty. If they refuse, they are actively depleting the marital estate, which is a breach of fiduciary duty to the 'family corporation.'

4. **The Accommodation:** We file for ADA accommodations for all hearings. My 'pressured speech' and anxiety are documented medical symptoms. If the court denies me time to process, they are denying me due process based on disability."
