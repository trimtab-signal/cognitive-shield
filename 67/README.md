# 🔺 COGNITIVE SHIELD - Phenix Navigator System

> **"I am the Trim Tab. I create the vacuum of change."**

## What Is This?

**Cognitive Shield** is an open-source assistive technology platform designed for neurodivergent individuals who struggle with high-entropy communication environments. It combines hardware mesh networking, AI-powered communication filtering, and quantum-geometric data modeling to create a "Digital Centaur" - a symbiotic system where human creativity is amplified by machine reliability.

### The Problem It Solves

For individuals with AuDHD (Autism + ADHD), every notification is a potential voltage spike. A simple text can trigger Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. Email threads become impossible to parse. The world operates at a frequency that doesn't match your wiring.

**Cognitive Shield** acts as an **impedance matching transformer** between you and the world - buffering, filtering, and translating communication so you can engage on your terms.

## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. Cognitive Shield (Backend)
AI-powered communication filter that:
- **Buffers** incoming messages (60-second "Catcher's Mitt")
- **Strips emotional voltage** from hostile communication
- **Extracts actionable data** (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front)
- **Assigns cognitive cost** (Spoon budget estimation)

### 2. Phenix Navigator (Hardware)
An ESP32-S3 handheld mesh communication device:
- **LoRa Radio** (915 MHz) - Long-range, off-grid capability
- **EAL6+ Secure Element** - Hardware root of trust
- **Haptic Feedback** - Tactile regulation for grounding
- **Meshtastic Compatible** - Open protocol mesh networking

### 3. Dashboard (React + Three.js)
Visual command center featuring:
- **Geodesic Dome** - 3D status visualization
- **Workbench** - Real-time message processing
- **Support Network Hub** - Dedicated portals for care team
- **Metabolic Tracking** - Spoon budget and wellness metrics

### 4. Wonky Sprout (Family App)
Gamified learning platform for children:
- **Skill Trees** - The Artificer, The Artisan, The Technomancer
- **Creative Zones** - Art Studio, Music Lab, Builder Zone
- **Family Mesh** - Coordinate care across the pod

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/trimtab-signal/cognitive-shield.git
cd cognitive-shield

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Deploy with Docker
./deploy.sh

# Or on Windows

## 🔺 The Tetrahedron Protocol

The system is built on **tetrahedral geometry** - the minimum stable structure in physics. 

### Why Tetrahedrons?
- **4 nodes** = Minimum structural system
- **6 edges** = Complete connectivity (everyone connected to everyone)
- **Isostatic rigidity** = Cannot deform without breaking

### Applied to Communication
A "thought" isn't valid until it has 4 nodes:
1. **Actor** - Who is doing it?
2. **Action** - What is being done?
3. **Context** - Where/When?
4. **Constraint** - With what resources?

Incomplete thoughts (3 nodes) are "planar hallucinations" - they lack the volume to exist in reality.

## 📋 Regulatory Classification

The Phenix Navigator is designed to qualify as:

- **FDA Class II Exempt** - Powered Communication System (21 CFR § 890.3710)
- **ADA Assistive Technology Device** - Under 20 U.S.C. § 1401(1)(A)

This classification protects the device as medical necessity for individuals with documented communication impairments.
