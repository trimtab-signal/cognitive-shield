# Presentation for Opposing Counsel: The "Inevitability" Memo

**PRIVACY NOTICE: This document contains sensitive personal and medical information. Access is restricted to authorized individuals only.**

## Goal
To signal that further aggression is futile because the disability is a static, medical fact, not a negotiation point.

## The Pitch
"Counsel, regarding the status of Mr. Johnson, you are litigating against a medical reality that has been certified as 'Total and Permanent' by treating providers.

We are putting you on notice of the following:

1. **You Cannot 'Depose' Autism:** The diagnosis of ASD and ADHD is confirmed by multiple independent evaluators, including specialists at Prosper Health. It is a neurodevelopmental condition, not a temporary illness. Continued attempts to frame his occupational disability as 'laziness' will be met with objective clinical data showing a neurological incompatibility with his former workspace.

2. **Parenting is Off the Table:** You are pursuing a 'fitness' argument that has already been medically debunked. Adrienne Maughon, PMHNP-BC, has explicitly stated that his functional limitations 'do not impede his ability to safely and effectively care for his children'.

3. **The Cost of Obstruction:** By blocking the RBCO and forcing a standard withdrawal or foreclosure, you are causing 'catastrophic instability' to the minor children. We will argue that this obstruction—resulting in utility disconnects and safety hazards—constitutes a failure to act in the children's best interest. The home is the children's primary social anchor; destroying it to win a financial point is a losing strategy."
